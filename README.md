An iPhone lockscreen Cydget

Clockswish is a simple an nice alternative clock for iPhone lockscreen. It works using Cydget on jailbroken devices.
Thanks to Codecademy for let me know about this wonderful animation and to Google and Rob Hawkes (https://github.com/robhawkes/google-bouncing-balls) that made it. This work is based on their ideas.

USAGE: Add these files in a folder called Clockswish.cydget in /System/Library/Lockcydget on your iPhone.
